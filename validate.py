"""Pre-push sanity checks for the DPF dashboard data pipeline.

Run this before (or as part of) every deploy. It catches the long tail of
"data drift" bugs that have bitten us in the past — mis-identified teams,
roster size anomalies, duplicate-player edge cases, keeper entries that
don't resolve, missing teamIds on transactions, etc.

Exit codes:
  0 — no fatal errors (warnings may still be printed)
  1 — at least one fatal error; DO NOT deploy

Usage:
  python3 validate.py            # run all checks
  python3 validate.py --fail-on-warn   # treat warnings as errors too

Integrate with the scheduled task and CI so a bad scrape can't make it into
a rebuilt index.html.
