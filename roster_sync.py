"""Compare CBS rosters with cbs_transactions.json and generate synthetic corrections.

CBS per-team transaction pages cap at ~30 entries, so older adds/drops get truncated.
This script reconciles the *effective* roster derived from transactions against the
*actual* CBS roster, and emits synthetic `Added`/`Dropped` transactions for any drift.

Synthetic transactions:
  * stamped with the current date (so they sort to the top of the log)
  * marked with `synthetic: true` at both the transaction and player level
  * include a short `note` so humans can see why they exist

Usage: python3 roster_sync.py
Reads: data/cbs_rosters.json (falls back to ./cbs_rosters.json), data/cbs_transactions.json
Writes: data/cbs_transactions.json with new synthetic entries appended and resorted.
